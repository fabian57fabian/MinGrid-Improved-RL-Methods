As we can see the 6x6 DoorKey trained with 5x5 agent has definitely improved the return_mean per FPS and it is really high compared to the agent trained in 6x6 from 'zero'.

Analyzing DoorKey 8x8 we can see that the basic agent can't be trained in 1 million FPS to be a 'good' agent when instead the 8x8 trained with 6x6 was doing fine just from the beginning.

Analyzing DoorKey 16x16 we can see that both agents are not trained really good and have a shitty return_mean. We can't conclude anything so we have to train with more than 10e6 frames to achieve some goals, plot the data and see the results.
